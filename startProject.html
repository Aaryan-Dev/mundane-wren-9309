              Kickstarter is specifically for creative projects in the following
              categories: Art, Comics, Crafts, Dance, Design, Fashion, Film &
              Video, Food, Games, Journalism, Music, Photography, Publishing,
              Technology, and Theater. Make an album, write a book, create an
              immersive theater experience, score a film — you name it. Read
              more about our project guidelines.

              Millions of people visit Kickstarter every week, but support
              always begins with people you know. Friends, fans, and the
              communities you’re a part of will likely be some of your earliest
              supporters, not to mention your biggest resources for spreading
              the word about your project.

            <p>
              Every Kickstarter project has its share of exhilarating and
              challenging moments, but the amount of work generally depends on
              the size and complexity of the project.
            </p>
            <p>
              Expect the first few days after launch to be very busy as you
              spread the word to your community, answer questions from potential
              backers, and more. You may need to spend the last few days
              rallying your social networks in order to reach your funding goal.
            </p>
            <p>
              Projects sometimes take on a life of their own, and in that case
              you should expect to spend more time creating and fulfilling
              rewards.

              We also recommend taking a look at our FAQs for more detailed
              information, along with the creator handbook for guidance on
              starting and running a project.

      <div id="seven1">
        <div>
          <h3>Kickstarter is just for creative projects.</h3>
          <p>
            We built Kickstarter as a tool for artists, designers, makers,
            musicians, and creative people everywhere. We’re proud to be the
            only platform that’s fully dedicated to building community around
            creative projects.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>All-or-nothing funding works.</h3>
          <p>
            Kickstarter’s all-or-nothing model allows you to choose a funding
            goal and a set number of days to reach that goal. This way, you
            don’t get stuck without enough funds to realize your project. It
            also gives backers incentive to pledge more to help you reach your
            goal.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3>Our community wants to support you.</h3>
          <p>
            Millions of backers agree — helping to create something new is
            exciting. People love peeking behind the creative curtain and
            directly supporting the creative process. In fact, 13.9 million
            people have pledged more than $3.39 billion to bring Kickstarter
            projects to life over the years.
